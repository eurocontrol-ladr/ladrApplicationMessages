## Data Definitions

IMPORTANT NOTE: the following table supports the consolidation of the definitions of some LADR data elements. The table does NOT display the LADR data elements that are natively covered by FIXM CORE, because the FIXM CORE definitions are specified by the FIXM standard and can not be changed. As an example, the LADR data elements Latitude/Longitude are natively supported by FIXM CORE and are therefore not listed in this table. The table below should therefore not be interpreted as the catalogue of the LADR data elements.
